Test if Better Dungeons mobs are underground and properly hostile to a non-creative player.

You need an Item/Block ID dump from your modpack. Look for conflicts and correct them.

You should add some mod items to the Better Dungeons chests. Does hexxit do that? Yes, hexxit has manual additions to the chests, look to them for ideas.

Confirm that thaumcraft nodes/ores spawn in all chunks (creative mode the "I can see nodes" item).

Feeling ambitious? Add Extrabiomes XL's biomes to Chocolate Quest's configs.

More project Zulu tweaks would be a good idea...

#Done

disable BOP redwoods, not that interesting
disable timber, also kinda dull

Too many armadillos
and too many penguins

Whisps need to be much rarer

reduce the number of sandworms

I've set up the twilight forest biomes in their own biome groups. Everything else is in an attribute-based biome group. In theory, this should create cross-pollination in mixed biomes (forest and cold, for example, should draw from both attribute sets).

I've blacklisted twilight forest in the updated config file. Theoretically, this should cause Twilight Forest to spawn normally (I think?)

Chocolate has a boader biome group definition.

Same with Project Zulu, you need to define biomes for the spawning of structures.

Ruins mod needs backups removed

Ruins mod needs an altered "Wasteland" setup to create your wasteland mega cities.

A backup of the live test install is needed.

Updated/revised configs need to be transferred to the live test install.

Test Twilight Forest spawning

Disable Snowy rainforest and Temperate rainforest in XL

Undergarden is labeld as a forest or something?

We need to settle on the tall tree biomes. There's too many in the game right now.
